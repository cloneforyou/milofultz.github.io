   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I’m probably going to do a hack job explaining this, so TL;DR: Zettelkasten makes all of your notes easier to develop, utilize, and organize for whatever you need them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Zettelkasten is a way of note taking and cataloguing that was popularized by sociologist Niklas Luhmann. This particular system intrigued me because it seems to overcome the issues that some basic note taking strategies have.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Note taking, in the way I was taught, is all about writing down what you’re thinking in a stream-of-consiousness, extremely linear way. This can be good for going through a whole thought process and getting it all down, but it’s lacking any ability to be anything but “start here and end up there”. It’s hard to link it to any other ideas without explicitly remembering what your thought process was. It is possible, with use of notes in the margins, post it notes, and maybe a synopsis (which is also a written out linear thought), but is very unwieldy and again relies on your remembering or regularly reviewing your documented info. Kind of defeats the purpose of documentation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The other way is to use a kind of &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mind_map&quot;&gt;mind map&lt;/a&gt;. Starting with a basic idea or concept, one branches out into all related things. Maybe “Food” branches off into “Bread”, “Vegetables”, “Nuts”, “Seeds”, and “Fruits”. Maybe “Bread” then branches off into “Focaccia”, “Yeast”, “Sourdough”, “Rolls”, “Pizza”, etc. This can go along for a LONG time, leading people into a more creative exploratory area, kind of allowing their brain to just utilize that free association. The problem that can occur here is again a lack of mobility. Under “Bread”, maybe you want to create some kind of grouping by if it is a yeasted bread, or if it is enriched. Maybe you want to expound on the greatness of sourdough crust on a pizza, where would you put it: under “Pizza” or “Sourdough”? How would you go about organizing these already existing elements in the map without having duplicates or just wasting time moving things around?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I believe that the Zettelkasten can help solve this issue. This allowed Luhmann the luxury of seeing this larger mapping of ideas and freedom of association that the mindmap provides, along with the linearity of thought that the more “academic” linear note taking technique provides, but without their rigid limitations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In my short time playing with this note taking concept, I have used it to take notes on a book I’m reading and help develop some of the major points I’ve seen into things that are relevant to me. I’m able to cross reference from different notes, allowing core concepts to stand on their own and also lead me down expository rabbit holes, allowing a development of smaller ideas that can create new connections once more.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The way I see it, the longer I keep my Zettelkasten, the more robust my index of information, the more connections I can make, the better I can understand and develop my ideas.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because you’re probably wondering what it actually is and not just my real glossy surface level explanation of it, I recommend reading more in depth on it in these two articles:&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Keyboard Remapping on OSX - Adding the Missing Insert Key</title>
   <link href="http://localhost:4000/2020/05/22/keyboard-remapping"/>
   <updated>2020-05-22T00:00:00-07:00</updated>
   <id>http://localhost:4000/2020/05/22/keyboard-remapping</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I was using &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.3eality.com/productions/reality-adlib-tracker&quot;&gt;Reality Adlib Tracker&lt;/a&gt; the other day and realized that Apple removed their insert key abilities a LONG time ago. The insert key is used quite a bit in these older programs for basic things like adding a line in your tracker, creating your pattern sequence, etc. Along with things like Dosbox, where these old relics are utilized, most of these older programs don’t allow new keybindings, so I had to dig around and find a new solution. I unfortunately couldn’t find anything directly related to trackers and stuff on any of their forums, so I figured I’d try and make something that could be found when searching for trackers, DOS, etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here’s one very simple and one not very simple but extremely interesting (read: difficult to understand for a rube like me) solution.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;simple-and-recommended&quot;&gt;SIMPLE And Recommended:&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Karabiner-Elements is an open-source program that allows you to remap any key on any device to another key. In this instance, I remapped my right alt/option key to the insert key, as I do not use that option key almost ever. In Karabiner, it’s honestly so simple, as you can see in the screenshot. Choose what key you want to press and what you want it to output. I tested this in RAD and it works beautifully.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://localhost:4000/assets/20200522karabiner.png&quot;&gt;Check out a picture of my settings here.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;not-as-simple-and-honestly-not-recommended&quot;&gt;NOT AS SIMPLE And Honestly Not Recommended:&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So this way is much more in depth and I honestly don’t really know a lot of what I am doing here. What I tested works for me, but of course YMMV.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I utilized the ideas listed in nanoant’s article, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nanoant.com/mac/macos-function-key-remapping-with-hidutil&quot;&gt;“macOS function key remapping with hidutil”&lt;/a&gt;, as well as the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.freebsddiary.org/APC/usb_hid_usages.php&quot;&gt;USB HID usage table&lt;/a&gt; and made a couple lines of code that can be input to achieve the same effect as above.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://localhost:4000/assets/20200522karabiner.png&quot;&gt;Check out a picture of my settings here.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Go into terminal and type the following:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;hidutil property --set '{&quot;UserKeyMapping&quot;:[
{&quot;HIDKeyboardModifierMappingSrc&quot;:0x7000000e6, &quot;HIDKeyboardModifierMappingDst&quot;:0x700000049}]}'
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What this does is the hidutil (Human Interface Design utility) is setting a new key map in the following way: key “right alt” is going to now output key “insert”. At this point, it wasn’t working, so I figured I needed to do the opposite, setting the “insert” key to map to “right alt”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;hidutil property --set '{&quot;UserKeyMapping&quot;:[
{&quot;HIDKeyboardModifierMappingSrc&quot;:0x700000049, &quot;HIDKeyboardModifierMappingDst&quot;:0x7000000e6}]}'
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This made it work for me, and I don’t fully understand, but it is interesting to note. There are a lot of interesting controls in the USB HID image table, so I wonder if I would need any of these strange controls in the future. At least I’ll know how to map them … maybe?&lt;/p&gt;
