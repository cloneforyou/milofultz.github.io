star_maker is a lo-fi screen saver or ambient visual using blessed. I originally made it so I could make a star visual for [a page on my website](https://more.milofultz.com/2020/07/07/spacelove) and then mucked around and realized it offered me both a chance to mess around with [blessed](https://github.com/jquast/blessed) and a really funny but relatively simple challenge.
