My brain started mashing together [Crank Dat Soulja Boy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8UFIYGkROII) with the first Star Realms song and I could not stop until they were all combined into one dumb megamix. If you don't know Star Realms or Soulja Boy, this probably won't make much sense, but you should at least check out [Star Realms](https://www.starrealms.com/), because it's a great deck-building game and a fun app to pass the time.
