I wanted to be able to take notes on a Youtube video without having to tab out of the window to a text editor all of the time. After seeing Josh Avanier's [Down](https://down.avanier.now.sh) and Hundred Rabbit's [Left](https://github.com/hundredrabbits/left), I realized I didn't need to do anything fancy, and in fact I preferred the minimalist layout that vanilla JS can provide.

This saves the text you write for a given Youtube video into local storage and will load it up again upon returning to the same video. Supports exporting to a text file and adding automatic timestamps.

Borrowed/stole heavily from [Skeleton CSS](http://getskeleton.com/) and Josh Avanier's [Down](https://down.avanier.now.sh) for code, stylesheets, and ideas.

- _20210105: Overhauled the program a bit. Added a title and refactored the CSS a bunch. Changed the style on a few elements and added a webfont to look better than the stock one._
- _20210106: Did some centering of the bottom editor in sub-1000px screens._
