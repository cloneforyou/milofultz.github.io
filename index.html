				<p>This is my repository for whatever I want. Currently whatever things I think are interesting live here, and will be my garden of weird little ideas and projects. Feel free to dig around and see what's going on and I would love to <a href="mailto:milopfultz@gmail.com">hear from you</a> about it. Nothing is sacred here and I want to hear your thoughts.</p>
				<p><h3>What I'm Currently Working On:</h3>
					<ul>
						<li>Programming in Python</li>
						<li>Making music with <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NjqNwHidpk">trackers</a></li>
						<li>Self-reflection and philosophy</li>
						<li>Building a Zettelkasten</li>
