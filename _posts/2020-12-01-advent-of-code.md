These are my solutions. I'm trying to do as many as I can in both Python and in Javascript. Plus I'm going to scope out people's answers in C and see what I can glean.

[**Check out the solutions on GitHub**](https://github.com/milofultz/aoc2020)

- _20201201: Solved the first challenge, starting up number 2_
- _20201202: Solved day 2_
- _20201203: Solved day 3_
- _20201204: Solved day 4_
- _20201205: Solved day 5_
- _20201206: Solved day 6. Definitely noticing the desire to be on the leaderboards and "cool" or "fast" or whatever and trying to go against that feeling. I would rather have effective solutions "slowly" than flail around and hope stuff works._
- _20201207: Solved day 7. Worked much more purposefully and without (as much) regard to the clock; still working on focusing on the process over the product._
