star_maker is a lo-fi screen saver or ambient visual using blessed. I originally made it so I could make a star visual for [a page on my website]({% post_url 2020-07-07-spacelove %}) and then mucked around and realized it offered me both a chance to mess around with [blessed](https://github.com/jquast/blessed) and a really funny but relatively simple challenge.

It looks like [this]({% post_url 2020-07-07-spacelove %}), but much more interesting.
